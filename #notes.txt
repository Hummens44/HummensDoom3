>Feedback
All damage feedback needs toning down, particularly with regards to screen shake. It's just too egregious.

>>Mancubus
Damage - increase/decrease? To test
Movement speeds - increase? To test

>>Imps
Faster movement
Projectiles have less of an arc / more direct aim, faster

>>zSec
No changes currently? Shotgunners are pretty lethal. Damage knock-back is too aggressive for player at present.

>>revenants
Faster projectiles
Faster movement
More HP

>>Hell Knight
Faster movement - but not too much as already quite imposing due to size and relative close-quarters of most encounters.
Projectiles have less of an arc / more direct aim, faster 

>>Weapons

>Plasma fire speed - high
Plasma damage - lower

>Pistol accuracy - higher
Pistol damage - average

>Shotgun spread - lower
Shotgun damage - high

>Machinegun spread - higher
Machinegun damage - lower

>Chaingun spread - higher
Changun damage - same?

>Grenade bounce - much lower

>Rocketlauncher - slower rockets

>BFG - faster projectile

>>Archvile
Increase health significantly

// key values for movement feel. Aiming for Quake1 style physics, fast-paced and a bit rubbery, more responsive. These are currently set to preferred values for the most part, but some more could be trialled. Currently based largely on OG Quake player movement speed values. Increased crouchrate for example could feel less awkward/snappy. pm_stamina to be disabled/infinite? pm_staminarate? pm_staminathreshold? how are these affected

// alter to mirror OG Doom stats ie: 200 health 200 armo(u)r? increase max health if increasing enemy damage stats also - but balance and check aginst abundance of health/armour pickups and wall units. For later on consideration after physics/movement gameplay locked down. Game should be more challenging with the alterations, not easier.
	
>>zombie_commando_cgun

increase spread and cone

>>>>zombie_commando

>>lost-soul

lower the knockback effect dramatically as it is *very* annoying. increase health to compensate difficulty when dealing with swarms, encourage player movement when engaging rather than just spamming plasma as your view gets knocked around wildly.

>>Cacodemon

increase health, maybe speed a little. At default, like shooting a floating baked potato, not very intimidating. Re-enable the corpse burn effect as they are bulky corpses.

>>wraith

increase health. Not sure what to do about these as they are not very formidable oncee you get their pattern down, particularly with new shotgun physics - wait for them to start reappearing and usually one good shotgun hit to the head deals with them before they've even finished appearing.

>>revenant

increase health, projectile speed and movement speed. Much too slow and easy to engage at default settings. Speed up those homing rockets, make cover important. OG Doom 2 movement speed is crazy compared to how they move at default values in Doom 3. They never get close enough to start slapping you around - see if that can be changed.

>>pinky

increase health. Reinstate burnaway effect as their corpses are massive and block combat when there's anything else trying to get at you. Already a decent speed but they only appear a handful of times and only a few times are there more than one to provide much of a threat. With new SG spread and damage, they're easy to dispatch - so increase health to counter this, given their low frequency in game.

>>spider-mini boss
burnaway to be set

>>trites

burnaway to be re-set, at present they tend to pile up due to the volume of them in encounters. They bounce around like crazy too which looks rather strange. They should go pop. That damage feedback though needs toning way down.

>>monster speeds
is monster movement tied to animation? how can this be altered? External tools or other .def files to be looked at?

>>further tools
What Doom 3 dev tools are there except for the built-in editor? Is it worth recreating a Doom map in Doom 3 (or using one someone else has made) to test out of the mechanics? Or a Quake 1 map for that matter? E1M1 in either case.
